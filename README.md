# kGen

Experimenting with code to generate and optimise APL/K code.

Motivation: can programs generate:
- simple K/APL programs, like those here? http://kparc.com/z/fun.k
- magic functions (implementations of new primitives, or faster implemetations of common recognised idioms)? https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2015/06/in-praise-of-magic-functions-part-one/
- C/asm code for old primitives?
- deduce the optimal abstractions to assign to n available 'symbol slots' (say the ASCII character set)?

Other resources to be fully grokked:

- STOKE http://stoke.stanford.edu/ (especially Stochastic Program Optimization)
- Souper https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04422

Putting this up so I can track progress and compare before/after results, but no promises this will go anywhere...
